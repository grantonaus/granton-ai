  // 3) your system prompt

Use concise, professional language. Write in the third person. Prioritise innovation, commercial potential, and public impact (such as job creation, economic contribution, or export readiness).

`.trim();

  // 4) generate the application
  let bodyText: string;
  try {
    const appRes = await generateText({
      model: openai("o3-mini"),
      temperature: 0.7,
      messages: [
        { role: "system", content: systemPrompt },
        ...messages,
        // { role: "user", content: combinedText },
        {
          role: "user",
          content: `

        
        The following text contains:
        - Company information (under "COMPANY DETAILS")
        - Grant information (under "GRANT DETAILS")
        - Budget plans (under "BUDGET DETAILS")
        - Optional attachments and website text
        - The full grant application form (under "APPLICATION FORM TEXT")
        - And optionally, grant guidelines for tone and alignment
        
        Your task:
        1. Extract the individual questions or sections from the "APPLICATION FORM TEXT".
        2. For each question, locate the most relevant information in the other sections.
        3. Write a complete and professional answer for each question, using formal third-person business English.
        4. Format the output like this:
           1. [Application form question]
              [your detailed answer]
           2. [Next question]
              ...
           3. ...
        
        Guidelines:
        - Answers can be short or long depending on what fits.
        - If any question cannot be answered based on the available content, write: "Answer not provided."
        - Maintain professional tone, clarity, and structure.
        - Do not include any explanation, JSON, or metadata in your output.
        - Only return the final, clean application with all questions and answers.
        
        Here is the full text to work with:
        ---
        ${combinedText}
        ---
        `.trim()
        },
//         {
//           role: "user", content: `
// Now generate a complete, structured grant application:
// ‚Ä¢ Professional third-person English
// ‚Ä¢ Sections: Executive Summary; Project Description; Budget Justification; Impact; Conclusion
// ‚Ä¢ Emphasise innovation, commercial potential, public impact
// Return ONLY the application text‚Äîno JSON or metadata.
//         `.trim()
//         }
      ],
    });
    bodyText = appRes.text.trim();
  } catch (err: any) {
    console.error("Application generation failed:", err);
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Generation failed", details: err.message }, { status: 502 });
  }

  // 5) return title + text
  return NextResponse.json({ title, text: bodyText }, { status: 200 });
}
